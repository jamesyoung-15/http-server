# Simple TCP Client and Server
TCP client and server written in C. Uses basic socket programming. Client writes message of "Hello world" to server and server reads message and prints message, client IP, and time sent.

## Code Demonstration
Example of how it works. Tested on my PC as server and Raspberry Pi as client.
